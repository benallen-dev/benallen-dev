### Hi there

- 🛠️ Currently working for [**ANWB**](http://www.anwb.nl)
- 🌱 I enjoy trying out new languages! Go is currently my favourite.
- ⚡ Professionally I usually spend most of my time on frontend development, but when I get the chance I like to join in the backend fun.
- 💬 One time I uploaded some half-baked C++ code for an Arduino/NRF24 module to emulate a Xiaomi light bar remote that surprisingly many people found useful
- 🤓 Vim is life
- ⚰️ Soon to be replaced by ChatGPT
- 🐦 I'm still just gonna call it "Twitter"

I use Arch, btw
