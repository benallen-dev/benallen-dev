### Hi there

- 🛠️ Currently working for [**ANWB**](http://www.anwb.nl)
- 🌱 Go is easily my favourite programming language
- ⚡ I used to be a frontend guy, but I got bored of arguing about stylesheets and moved to the backend
- 🔮 Hypermedia APIs are the future. JSON is great, but HTML is just better
- 💬 One time I uploaded some half-baked C++ code for an Arduino/NRF24 module to emulate a Xiaomi light bar remote that surprisingly many people found useful
- 🤓 Vim is life
- ⚰️ Soon to be replaced by ChatGPT
- 🐦 Feel free to troll me on Twitter

I use Arch, btw
