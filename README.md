### Checking me out for recruitment? Sweet!

Have fun checking out my hobby projects, some of them are even feature-complete. I know there's no tests, half these repos is just me trying random stuff out.

### Short version

- 🛠️ Currently working for [**ANWB**](http://www.anwb.nl)
- 🌱 Go is easily my favourite programming language
- ⚡ Folks would be way better off if we all stopped splitting web dev into frontend/backend
- 🔮 Hypermedia APIs are pretty great, but in retrospect I'm not sure they're great at everything
- 💬 One time I uploaded some half-baked C++ code for an Arduino/NRF24 module to emulate a Xiaomi light bar remote that surprisingly many people found useful
- 🤓 Vim is life
- ⚰️ ChatGPT might replace me, but someone has to write terrible code to train the LLMs on, might as well be me

I use Arch, btw
